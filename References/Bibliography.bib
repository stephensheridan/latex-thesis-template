@ARTICLE{Aiello2012-sg,
  title    = "{Performance assessment and analysis of DNS tunneling tools}",
  author   = "Aiello, Maurizio and Merlo, Alessio and Papaleo, Gianluca",
  abstract = "DNS tunnels are built by proper tools that allow embedding data
              on DNS queries and responses. Each tool has its own strategies
              that affect the network performance in a unique way. In this
              article, we propose an architectural analysis of the current
              state-of-the-art of DNS tunneling tools. Then, we provide a
              comparative evaluation of such tools in term of performance, as a
              first step towards the possibility to relate each tool with a
              specific pattern of the DNS traffic. To this aim, we define an
              assessment of the tools in three different network configurations
              based on three performance metrics. We finally analyse the
              testing results and provide a first characterization of the
              performance of each tool.",

  author    = "Lampson, Butler W",
  abstract  = "This note explores the problem of confining a program during its
               execution so that it cannot transmit information to any other
               program except its caller. A set of examples attempts to stake
               out the boundaries of the problem. Necessary conditions for a
               solution are stated and informally justified.",
